Readme 

The repository is divided by health intervntion and type of adoption

folders:

1) ab_act_red (activity based adopton activity reduction)
2) ab_mask (activity based adoption face mask)
	2.1) simulation_ab_mask.jl (for adoption below activity threshold) 
	2.2) simulation_ab_mask_l.jl (for adoption above activity threshold) 
3) ab_vax (activity based adoption vaccination)
	3.1) simulation_ab_vax.jl (for adoption below activity threshold) 
	3.2) simulation_ab_vax_l.jl (for adoption above activity threshold) 	
4) casestudy_interplay
	4.1) simulation_casestudy_mask.jl
	4.2) simulation_casestudy_sotty.jl
	4.3) simulation_casestudy_vax.jl
5) casestudy_overlap
	5.1) simulation_casestudy_overlap.jl (overlap vaccination and activity red)
	5.2) simulation_casestudy_overlap_mask.jl (overlap vaccination and face mask)
6)random_adoption (only contains siulation_ps.jl but data file for all 3 health intervention)

In the folders are present also the corresponding datasimulation files.

For data simulation NOT casestudy ( 1) 2) 3) 6) ):
first row of data simulation contains values of R_0 (usually 13, from 0), 
second row the corresponding values of lambda (0 to 1), 
third to last (usually 102th) contains the r at the end of the simulation

For data simulation in casestudy ( 4) 5) ):
each column is a simulation that stops after around 1000 time steps,
files are both for inf and rec, each row contains the value at the corresponding time step 

7) Parameters (folder), parameters.csv, and parameters_ab.csv

each simulation file call for a parameters file while running:

parameters.csv is used with random_adoption.csv is used to turn on/off health intervention

sim,eps,N_samp,α,i0,f,v,ψ,w,γ,p,r_s,r_i,α_m,mu,m
90,"0,001",100000,"2,1","0,01","0,0","0,0","0,8","0,1","0,1","0,8","0,0","0,0","0,0","0,01",2

sim -> number of simulation to run
eps -> minimum value of the power law distribution
N -> population in the simulation (usually 10^5)
α -> power of the distribution
i0 -> seed of the infection, fraction of initial infected
f -> fraction of random adopter of vax (set to 0 turn off vaccination)
v -> effectiveness of vax (set to 0 turn off vaccination)
ψ -> activity reduction for susceptibles
w -> fraction of activity reduction users among susceptibles 
γ -> activity reduction for infected
p -> fraction of activity reduction users among infected
r_s -> fraction of face mask adopters among susceptible (0 turns off)
r_i -> fraction of face mask adopters among infected (0 turns off)
α_m -> reduction in infectivity caused by use of face mask (1 no effect)
mu -> recovery rate
m -> link generated by random adopters

Simulation generates also param files named in a similar way o the data file containing the paramaters used for the simulation
these files have one more column containing the time needed for the simulation

To run the code write as argument the file name, it outputs a daatfie_filename and a param_filename (usually used the parameters as name)

parameters_ab.csv is used for the activity based adoption simulation.
Parameters and instruction are similar to the previous case

In the Paramaters folder are present different csv file.
Have been used during the case studies (it was faster change the name in the source code than change the parameter file).
Before each simulation change the parameter file in the code.

I used to change the lambda vector in the code when I needed to test in the code, and not make it a tunable parameter.

The folder path is complete so you have tomodify it.

8) data_simulation -> folder with other data generated while testing and not used during the plot

9) jupyter_plot -> contains jupyter notebokes used to test and plot the data

10) images_plot -> all the images generated
